<h2>User Activity Tracker â€“ Java Project </h2>

Developed a system-level application to monitor and log user activities on Windows using Java and JNA.

Logged user login/logout events, file access operations, and active application usage in real time.

Integrated native Windows API (Win32) via JNA to capture active window changes.

Consolidated all logs into a centralized file (userActivitylog.txt) with timestamped entries for audit purposes.

Used multi-threading for concurrent tracking of system activities without blocking.

Designed for lightweight background operation and extensibility.
